# Oh, hi! I'm Geraldine âœ¨

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building tools that make learning and everyday life a little easier.

With a background in UX design and teaching, empathy, clarity, and accessibility shape everything I build. My favorite projects are mission-driven, combining usability with thoughtful design.

In free time, I enjoy playing video games, crocheting, and all things that spark joy. ðŸ’–
