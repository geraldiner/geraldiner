Oh, hi! I'm Geraldine! âœ¨

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a focus on frontend development, building scalable, accessible, and performant web experiences. I specialize in React and JavaScript/TypeScript, with backend experience in Node.js, Express, and Python.

In the past, Iâ€™ve been a science teacher at the high school I graduated from (working with my previous teachers!), a graphic designer on a video game based on Filipino history and culture, and a web developer for a research group at the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in Hawai'i and the Pacific.

In my free time, I enjoy video games, crochet, and all things that spark joy. ðŸ’–
