Oh, hi! I'm Geraldine!

Iâ€™m a fullstack software engineer with a focus on frontend development, building scalable, accessible, and performant web experiences. I specialize in **React** and **JavaScript/TypeScript**, with backend experience in **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Python**.

I enjoy turning complex problems into intuitive user experiences and collaborating with design, product, and marketing teams to deliver solutions that drive real business impact. My work includes **modernizing codebases**, **improving site performance**, and **implementing SEO strategies**.

Iâ€™m passionate about **clean code**, **strong documentation**, and **helping teams move faster**. I thrive in environments where thoughtful engineering, collaboration, and user impact come together.

In the past, Iâ€™ve been a science teacher at the high school I graduated from (working with my previous teachers!), a graphic designer on a video game based on Filipino history and culture, and a web developer for a research group at the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in Hawai'i and the Pacific.

In my free time, I enjoy video games, crochet, and all things that spark joy.
